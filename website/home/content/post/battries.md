## Battries Included

Otter takes a "batteries included" approach to configuration management. Instead of relying on external community-contributed resources like "recipes" or "formula", Otter
includes a smaller set of pre-defined core resources which are setup to best-practice. Because Otter is "container oriented" it only focuses on configuring 
a server to run container infrastructure.
